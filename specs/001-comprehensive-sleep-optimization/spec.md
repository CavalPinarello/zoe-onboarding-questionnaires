## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a person struggling with sleep quality, I want a comprehensive platform that helps me understand my sleep patterns, provides personalized interventions, connects me with others facing similar challenges, and gives me access to medical expertise when needed, so that I can achieve consistently better sleep and improved overall health.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with poor sleep quality, **When** they use the Apple Watch voice check-in each morning, **Then** the system captures their subjective sleep feedback and correlates it with biometric data
2. **Given** collected sleep data over 7+ days, **When** viewing the iPhone dashboard, **Then** the user sees their sleep health score, trends, and personalized insights
3. **Given** a user's sleep profile and patterns, **When** accessing daily protocols, **Then** they receive actionable, time-bound interventions adapted to their current state
4. **Given** a successful sleep improvement protocol, **When** sharing to the community, **Then** other users with similar profiles can discover and validate the protocol
5. **Given** concerning sleep symptoms reported to Lumos AI, **When** medical escalation is triggered, **Then** the user can schedule a consultation with a sleep physician
6. **Given** a physician with patients on the platform, **When** accessing the dashboard, **Then** they can monitor patient progress, validate protocols, and provide oversight

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Apple Watch data sync fails? ‚Üí System uses manual check-ins and provides limited functionality
- How does system handle contradictory data (user reports good sleep but biometrics show poor quality)? ‚Üí Prioritizes user perception while flagging discrepancy for review
- What if community-shared protocol causes adverse effects? ‚Üí Medical review process and user reporting system to remove harmful content
- How does Lumos AI handle emergency medical situations? ‚Üí Immediate escalation with clear instructions to seek emergency care

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Platform Requirements
