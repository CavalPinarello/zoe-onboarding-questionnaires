# Research Document: ZOE Sleep Optimization Platform

**Feature**: ZOE Sleep Optimization Platform  
**Date**: 2025-09-15  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technical Decisions

## Executive Summary
This document consolidates research findings and technical decisions for the ZOE Sleep Optimization Platform, resolving all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification and establishing foundational technical choices.

## Research Findings

### 1. HIPAA Compliance & Data Retention
**Question**: What is the required data retention period for sleep health data?

**Decision**: 7-year retention period for all health-related data  
**Rationale**: 
- HIPAA requires covered entities to retain medical records for minimum 6 years from creation or last use
- Many state laws require 7-10 years retention (e.g., California requires 7 years)
- Sleep data with medical provider involvement constitutes Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Litigation hold considerations favor longer retention

**Alternatives Considered**:
- 3-year retention: Rejected - insufficient for state compliance
- 10-year retention: Rejected - excessive storage costs without clear benefit
- User-defined retention: Rejected - compliance complexity and user confusion

### 2. Trend Analysis Timeframe
**Question**: What time period should be used for sleep pattern trend analysis?

**Decision**: 30-day default with 7, 14, 30, 90, and 365-day options  
**Rationale**:
- 30 days captures full monthly cycles including weekday/weekend patterns
- Aligns with typical habit formation timeframe (21-66 days)
- Sufficient data for statistical significance
- Matches insurance and clinical reporting periods

**Alternatives Considered**:
- 14-day only: Rejected - insufficient for pattern detection
- 90-day default: Rejected - too much data for mobile display
- Rolling window: Rejected - confusing for users

### 3. System Scale & Concurrent Users
**Question**: How many concurrent users should the system support?

**Decision**: Initial capacity for 10,000 concurrent users, architecture for 100,000+  
**Rationale**:
- Typical digital health app engagement rate is 10-15% concurrent
- 10K concurrent supports ~100K registered users initially
- Horizontal scaling architecture allows growth
- Cost-effective starting point with clear scaling path

**Alternatives Considered**:
- 1,000 users: Rejected - too limiting for growth
- 1 million users: Rejected - premature optimization, excessive initial cost
- Auto-scaling only: Rejected - need baseline capacity planning

### 4. Data Synchronization Latency
**Question**: What is acceptable sync delay between devices?

**Decision**: 500ms target latency, 2-second maximum tolerance  
**Rationale**:
- 500ms provides near real-time feel for users
- 2 seconds prevents user confusion about data currency
- Critical medical escalations use priority queue (<100ms)
- Aligns with mobile app performance standards

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Real-time (<100ms): Rejected - technically complex, battery drain
- 5-second delay: Rejected - poor user experience
- Eventual consistency only: Rejected - medical safety concerns

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 5. HealthKit Integration Strategy
**Research Finding**: Best practices for Apple Health integration

**Decision**: HealthKit as primary data source with background delivery  
**Key Considerations**:
- Use HKObserverQuery for background updates
- Batch process updates to preserve battery
- Store local cache for offline access
- Request minimal necessary permissions
- Implement proper authorization flows

### 6. Voice Processing on Apple Watch
**Research Finding**: Optimization techniques for watchOS voice input

**Decision**: On-device processing with cloud fallback  
**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use SFSpeechRecognizer for on-device transcription
- Limit recordings to 10 seconds maximum
- Process locally when possible (70% of cases)
- Cloud processing for complex utterances
- Implement voice activity detection for battery optimization

### 7. Community Matching Algorithms
**Research Finding**: Effective algorithms for health profile matching

**Decision**: Cosine similarity with weighted feature vectors  
**Algorithm Components**:
- Chronotype weight: 0.3
- Sleep duration similarity: 0.2
- Sleep quality patterns: 0.2
- Demographics: 0.15
- Lifestyle factors: 0.15
- Minimum similarity threshold: 0.7

**Privacy Approach**:
- K-anonymity with k=5 minimum
- Differential privacy for aggregate statistics
- No direct user identification in matches

### 8. Medical Escalation Patterns
**Research Finding**: Best practices for AI-to-physician handoff

**Decision**: Three-tier escalation system  
**Tiers**:
1. **Immediate** (<5 minutes): Emergency symptoms, suicidal ideation
2. **Urgent** (<24 hours): Sleep apnea symptoms, medication interactions
3. **Routine** (<72 hours): Persistent issues, protocol ineffectiveness

**Escalation Triggers**:
- Keyword detection (validated symptom list)
- Pattern recognition (declining metrics >7 days)
- User request (explicit escalation)
- AI confidence threshold (<60% confidence)

## Platform-Specific Decisions

### 9. iOS/watchOS Development
**Decision**: Native SwiftUI with iOS 16+ minimum  
**Rationale**:
- SwiftUI maturity and performance improvements in iOS 16
- 85%+ iOS 16 adoption rate
- Native performance critical for health apps
- Better HealthKit integration

### 10. Web Portal Technology
**Decision**: Next.js 14 with App Router  
**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering for performance
- Built-in API routes for backend
- Excellent TypeScript support
- React ecosystem maturity
- Vercel deployment simplicity

### 11. Database Architecture
**Decision**: PostgreSQL primary, Redis cache, CloudKit sync  
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL: ACID compliance for health data
- Redis: Session management and real-time features
- CloudKit: Native Apple ecosystem sync
- Proven scalability path

### 12. AI Integration
**Decision**: Claude AI for Lumos assistant  
**Rationale**:
- Superior context handling for medical conversations
- Responsible AI practices
- Clear API boundaries
- Consistent personality implementation
- Good safety controls

## Security & Compliance Considerations

### 13. HIPAA Technical Safeguards
**Requirements Identified**:
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Access controls with role-based permissions
- Audit logging for all PHI access
- Automatic logoff after 30 minutes
- Data backup and disaster recovery

### 14. Authentication Strategy
