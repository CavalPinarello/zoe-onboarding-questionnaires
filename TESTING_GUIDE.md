## üîÑ Testing Multiple Patients

You can test multiple patient journeys simultaneously:

### Method 1: Different Browser Sessions
1. **Regular browser window** = Patient 1
2. **Incognito/Private window** = Patient 2
3. **Different browser** (Chrome vs Firefox) = Patient 3

### Method 2: Different Devices
- Your laptop = Patient 1
- Your phone = Patient 2
- Tablet = Patient 3

Each maintains separate progress via browser local storage!

## üíæ Progress Persistence

The app automatically saves your progress:
- Close the browser and reopen = Resume exactly where you left off
- Answer a few questions, come back tomorrow = Your progress is saved
- Data stored locally in your browser (not sent to any server)

To **reset and start fresh:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application > Local Storage
3. Find `zoeProgress` and delete it
4. Refresh the page
